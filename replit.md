## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite
- **Routing**: wouter
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **API Design**: RESTful API
- **Authentication**: Passport.js (local strategy, session-based)
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **File Structure**: Modular, with route handlers and storage abstraction

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Schema**: Double-entry accounting structure (accounts, transactions, ledger entries)
- **Migrations**: Automated system
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed using `connect-pg-simple` for persistence
- **Reconciliation**: Tables `reconciliations` and `reconciliation_items` to track sessions and cleared transactions.

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session Management**: Express sessions
- **User Roles**: Multi-company support with role-based permissions
- **Security**: Password hashing (scrypt)
- **Access Control**: Route-level authentication

### Key Business Logic
- **Double-Entry Accounting**: Automatic ledger entry generation.
- **Invoice Management**: Full lifecycle with balance and payment application.
- **Payment Processing**: Multiple methods, unified credit tracking, and `payment_applications` as a source of truth.
- **Financial Reporting**: Real-time balance calculations and account books, including detailed, categorized Balance Sheets.
- **Tax Management**: Configurable sales tax rates.
- **Account Balance Calculation**: Real-time calculation based on ledger entries, differentiating between account types.
- **Bank Transaction Matching**: Rule-based matching (amount, date, description, reference) with confidence scoring. Supports matching to single/multiple invoices/bills and allocating differences.
  - **Match Types**: Invoice/Bill Match (creates payment), Manual Entry Link (links to existing), Manual Override (user categorization).
  - **Multi-Match with Difference**: Allows splitting a bank transaction across multiple invoices/bills and allocating remaining amounts to specific income/expense accounts.
- **Transaction Categorization Rules**: Automated rule-based categorization for imported bank transactions.
  - Rules define conditions (description matching, amount ranges) and actions (assign account, contact, memo).
  - Priority-based execution: rules are evaluated in order until first match.
  - Auto-apply on import: rules automatically categorize transactions when synced via Plaid or uploaded via CSV.
  - Manual application: "Apply Rules" button to categorize existing uncategorized transactions.
  - Full CRUD: create, edit, enable/disable, delete, and reorder rules via UI.
- **Inline Contact Creation**: All major forms (Invoice, Bill, Expense, Sales Receipt, Journal Entry) support creating customers and vendors on-the-fly through inline dialogs.
  - **AddCustomerDialog** and **AddVendorDialog** components reuse existing form validation.
  - New contacts are automatically selected after creation.
  - Journal Entry forms show both customer and vendor creation options since the Name field can be either type.
- **Inline Product Creation**: Invoice and Sales Receipt forms support creating products on-the-fly with automatic field population.
  - Product dialog returns full product object to avoid stale closure issues.
  - Newly created products are automatically selected in the form.
- **Multi-Currency Support** (Core Features Complete - Tasks 1-12):
  - **Database Schema**: 5 dedicated tables (currencies with 80 world currencies seeded, exchange_rates with unique daily rate constraint, fx_realizations, fx_revaluations, currency_locks)
  - **Preferences**: One-time multi-currency enablement with locked home currency selection and timestamp tracking
  - **Contacts**: Currency field on customers/vendors, automatically locked after first transaction to prevent changes
  - **Transactions**: Currency, exchange_rate, and foreign_amount fields to support multi-currency transactions
  - **Backend API**: Complete CRUD endpoints for currencies and exchange rates with Zod validation
  - **Currency Settings UI**: SearchableSelect for home currency, one-time enablement enforcement, proper state management
  - **Exchange Rates Manager**: Full CRUD interface with date-based rates, currency filtering, sorted listing, unique constraint preventing duplicate same-day pairs
  - **Contact Forms**: Currency selectors in all customer/vendor creation/edit forms with automatic locking when transactions exist
  - **Lock Prevention**: ContactEditForm queries `/api/contacts/:id/transactions` and disables currency field for both customers and vendors with existing transactions
  - **Invoice/Bill Forms**: Full multi-currency integration with currency selector, exchange rate auto-fetch, foreign/home amount display, proper form initialization to homeCurrency
  - **FX Accounts**: Realized FX Gain (4300, other_income) and Realized FX Loss (7100, other_expense) accounts created
  - **Realized FX Gain/Loss**: Automatic calculation when payments are applied to foreign currency invoices at different exchange rates
    - Compares invoice exchange rate with payment exchange rate (defaults to invoice rate if not provided)
    - Formula: gainLossAmount = foreignAmountPaid × (paymentRate - invoiceRate)
    - Records fx_realization entries with full context (transactionId, paymentId, rates, amounts, date)
    - Creates ledger entries: gains debit AR + credit FX Gain; losses debit FX Loss + credit AR
    - Production-ready for AR invoice payments
  - **Unrealized FX Revaluation**: Month-end FX revaluation system to calculate and post unrealized gains/losses
    - **Storage Method**: `getForeignCurrencyBalances()` calculates foreign currency balances by account type (AR, AP, Bank) with weighted average exchange rates
    - **Preview Endpoint**: POST `/api/fx-revaluations/calculate` previews unrealized gains/losses by comparing original rates to revaluation date rates
    - **Posting Endpoint**: POST `/api/fx-revaluations/post` creates journal entries posting unrealized FX gains/losses to AR/AP/Bank and FX Gain/Loss accounts
    - **UI Page**: FX Revaluation page at `/fx-revaluation` with date selector, calculation preview table, and post button
  - **Automatic Exchange Rate Updates**: Integration with ExchangeRate-API.com for automatic rate fetching
    - **API Service**: `exchange-rate-service.ts` handles fetching rates from ExchangeRate-API.com based on home currency
    - **Auto-Fetch on Demand**: GET `/api/exchange-rates/rate` endpoint automatically fetches from API if rate doesn't exist in database
    - **Daily Startup Check**: Server fetches yesterday's exchange rates on startup (if multi-currency enabled and API key configured)
    - **Configuration**: Requires `EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY` environment variable (free tier supports commercial use)
    - **Rate Storage**: All fetched rates are stored in database with `effectiveDate`, `isManual=false` for audit trail
  - **Editable Exchange Rates**: User-editable exchange rate functionality across all transaction forms
    - **ExchangeRateInput Component**: Reusable component showing fetched exchange rate with edit/save/cancel UI
    - **ExchangeRateUpdateDialog Component**: Modal asking users whether to update "this transaction only" or "all transactions on this date"
    - **Backend Endpoint**: PUT `/api/exchange-rates` handles both update scopes with `isManual` flag
    - **Form Integration**: Integrated into all transaction forms (Invoice, Bill, Expense, SalesReceipt, Cheque, Deposit, Transfer, JournalEntry)
    - **Foreign Currency Detection**: Forms automatically detect foreign currency from contacts (Invoice/Bill/Expense/SalesReceipt) or accounts (Cheque/Deposit/Transfer/JournalEntry)
    - **Update Scopes**: Transaction-only updates local state; all-on-date updates database and invalidates cache
    - **User Experience**: Edit button triggers inline editing, save prompts for scope selection, toast notifications confirm updates
  - **Status**: Complete multi-currency implementation with automatic exchange rate updates, user-editable rates across all forms, realized/unrealized FX gain/loss tracking, and comprehensive reporting
